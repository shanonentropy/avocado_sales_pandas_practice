the *.py was intial attempt at using teh avocado sales dataset to practice pandas skillset
the jypyter notebook is a more extensive attempt, where pandas is used to explore the sales data and pipeline with gridsearch is used to create a KNN model. Note: model doesn't do any better than baseline
/n the next steps would be to build a randforest model optimized using randomsearch and adding new features
